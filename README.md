# EEE 254
This repository contains codes developed algorithmically to reinforce the understanding of computer architecture(the way a computer thinks and processes), using the most efficient way to get the best performance  and the art of programming.

## Binary Search (Bisection Method)
``` python

user_num= int(input('Enter the nuber you want to find the cube root of'))
def find_cube_root (number, epsilon=0.01):
    start_time= time.time()
    steps = 0
    #since cube root of a negative number is negative, we search within negative range of the number, the same approach to the positive number. If number is 0, high and low are set to 0 [1 is the least positive number and -1 the highest negative number]
    low = min(-1, number) if number < 0 else 0
    high = max(1, number) if number > 0 else 0
    #the low,high is the valid interval that contains cube root
    guess = (high + low) / 2.0  #bisection

    while abs(guess ** 3 - number) > epsilon:
        if guess ** 3 < number:
        #set low to guess since evaluating for values below guess will cube to something smaller which can be eliminated
            low = guess
        else:
        #set high to guess since evaluating for values above guess willl cube to something bigger which can be eliminated
            high = guess
        guess = (high + low) / 2.0
        steps += 1
    end_time= time.time()
    total_time= end_time - start_time

    return guess, steps, total_time
 ```

```python
